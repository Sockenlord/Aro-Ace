      As terms for specific identities, aromantic refers to someone who experiences little to no romantic attraction and
      asexual means someone who experiences little to no sexual attraction. Aromantic asexual people may or may not
      feel other forms of attraction that are neither romantic nor sexual such as sensual, platonic and alterous.
      Some aromantic, asexual, or aromantic asexual people may also feel romantic or sexual attraction for others, but
      don't feel a need to act on their attraction. They may also only see this attraction as fantasy, which is why
      some don't feel a need to act on it.
